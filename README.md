# QuizGame
A Javascript Based Quiz Game with interactive choice keys a saveable score from your last load in and the game reacts to your success or failure at the questions. The game is designed to be slightly punitive on wrong answers with easy to moderate questions and a few freebies. At the end of the clock it score your scores and logs your results after promting you to enter your name in a text box. Right now the game doesn't end on its own if you hit the last quest so their are slighltly more questions to compensate for that but will end on the timer and the wrong answers deduct from time remaining.

Much help and insperataion from the Joe and Lindsey and Henry and William and Laura at Coding Boot Camp, in particular thank you very much to Lindsey for spending some time to teach me how to see some logic hours I had missed initially. Also big thanks to my tutor Kyle who spend an hour helping me try to debug some errors in the local storage data retrieval finally realized using arrays to recieve the data back from local storage was the way to go. 

CSS still pretty rough looking but was really focused on trying to make it work instead.
